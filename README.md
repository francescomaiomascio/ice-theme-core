ICE Theme is an **early-stage design and styling repository** for the ICE
ecosystem.

It contains visual assets, CSS primitives, layout styles, and experimental
design tokens used to explore and prototype the visual identity of ICE
applications.

This repository is **embrional and subject to heavy iteration**.

---

## Purpose

ICE Theme exists to:

- Explore visual identity and styling direction
- Centralize shared CSS primitives and tokens
- Host icons, fonts, and brand assets
- Support early UI experimentation
- Act as a foundation for future design systems

This repository does **not** define a finalized design system.

---

## Scope

Current contents may include:

- Base CSS resets and utilities
- Layout and workspace styles
- Component-level CSS experiments
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Themes and visual variants
- Icons and branding assets

Structure and naming are expected to evolve.

---

## Design Notes

- No stability guarantees
- Styles and tokens may change frequently
- File organization is provisional
- Assets may be replaced or removed

This repository prioritizes **experimentation over consistency**.

---

## Usage

ICE Theme is intended for **internal development use**.

It may be referenced by:
- ICE Studio
- Web interfaces
- Documentation styling
- UI and layout prototypes

External consumption is not a goal at this stage.

---

## Status

This project is in an **early exploratory phase**.
Consider all contents provisional.
